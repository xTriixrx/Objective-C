// Like primitive variables, blocks are created and stored on the stack. That is, the block
// will be destroyed along with the stack frame when the function or method that created
// the block returns. Sometimes, however your block needs to live longer than that. For
// example, it could become an instance variable of an object. In this case you must copy
// your block from the stack to the heap.
// ArrayEnumerationBlock iVarDevowelizer = [devowelizer copy];
// Now a copy of the block exists on the heap, it is now a heap-based block instead of a
// stack-based block, and the new block variable is a pointer to the block.

// A heap-based block behaving like an object comes with some memory management issues:

// What about variables that are used with the block?

// A block typically uses other variables (both primitive and pointers to objects) within
// its code that were created outside of it. To make sure these external variables will be
// available for as long as the block need them, the variables are captured by the block
// when the copy is made.

// For primitive variables, this means the values are copied and stored as local variables
// within the block. For pointers, the block itself will keep a strong reference to any
// objects it references. That means that any objects referred to by the block are
// guaranteed to live at least as long as the block itself. (This is where the difference
// lies between blocks and function pointers).

// Can these strong references lead to retain cycles/circular references?

// Yes, the fix is the same, one of the references need to become a weak reference. To do
// this, declare a __weak pointer outside the block and then reference this pointer within
// the block instead.

// Can I change the variables that the block has copied?

// By default, the variables captured by a block are constant within the block, and you
// cannot change their values. Object pointer variables, for example are constant within
// the scope of the block. (Although you can still send the object messages that can
// change its contents, you cannot modify the pointer itself).

// Sometimes however, you want to be able to modify an external variable within a block. To
// do this, you must declare the external variable using the __block keyword. For instance,
// in the following code, you increment the external variable counter.

// __block int counter = 0;
// void (^counterBlock)() = ^{ counter++; };
//  ...
// counterBlock() Increments counter to 1
// counterBlock() Increments counter to 2
