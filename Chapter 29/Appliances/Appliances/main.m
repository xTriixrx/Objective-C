// 4 Rules for Objective-C programmers for writing initializers:

// 1: If a class has several initalizers, only one should do the real work. That
// method is known as the designated initializer. All other initializers should call
// either directly or indirectly, the designated initializer.

// 2: The designated initializer will call the superclass's designated initializer
// before initializing its instance variables.

// 3: If the designated initializer of your class has a different name than the designated
// initializer of its superclass, you must override the superclass's designated initializer
// so that it calls the new designated initializer.

// 4: If you have several initializers, clearly document which is the designated
// initializer in the header file.



// Deadly init methods
// Every once in a while, however, you can't safely override the superclass's designated initializer.
// Lets say that you are creating a subclass of NSObject called WallSafe, and its designated initializer
// is initWithSecretCode:. However, having a default value for secretCode is not secure enough for your
// application. This means that the pattern we have been using - overriding init to call the new class's
// designated initializer with default values - is not acceptable.

// An instance of WallSafe will still respond to an init message so someone still could easily do this:
// WallSafe *ws = [[WallSafe alloc] init];
// The best thing to do is to override the superclass's designated initalizer in a way that lets developers
// know that they have made a mistake and tells them how to fix it:

//- (id)init
//{
//    @throw [NSException exceptionWithName:@"WallSafeInitialization"
//                                   reason:@"Use initWithSecretCode, not init"
//                                 userInfo:nil];
//}


// Why is key-value coding interesting? Anytime a standard framework wants to push data into your objects,
// it will use setValue:forKey:. Anytime a standard framework wants to read data from your objects, it will
// use valueForKey:. For example, Core Data is a framework that makes it easy to save your objects to a SQLite
// database and then bring them back to life. It manipulates your custom data-bearing objects using key-value coding.
